For starters Im not good at writing RSPECs. you may encounter issues. 
Feel free to look at solutions if you feel that your code should be passing the RSPECs
but the rspec is being too picky.

the order I would complete this is is as follows

deck
pile
board
hand
player

KNOWN ISSUES
for the deck.take(n) method
use this 
 @cards.pop(n)
or else you will likely fail most rspecs.

Happy studying!
